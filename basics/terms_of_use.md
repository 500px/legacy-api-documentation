# Terms of Use

This agreement sets out the terms and conditions (the "API Terms of Use") pursuant to which you are licensed by 500px Inc. ("500px") to use the 500px application programming interfaces (the "500px APIs"). By accessing or using 500px APIs in any way you acknowledge and agree on your own behalf and on behalf of the company or entity you represent ("You") that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by the API Terms of Use, our 500px site terms [http://500px.com/terms](http://500px.com/terms) and our 500px site privacy policy [http://500px.com/privacy](http://500px.com/privacy), (collectively the "500px Agreement") all of which shall govern your relationship with 500px and your access to its members. 500px reserves the right to alter, delete and/or add to the 500px Agreement at its discretion. You can always find the most recent version of 500px Agreement on the following pages: [https://github.com/500px/api-documentation/blob/master/basics/terms_of_use.md](https://github.com/500px/api-documentation/blob/master/basics/terms_of_use.md).

If you disagree with any part of the API Terms of Use or any other terms of the 500px Agreement, 500px does not grant you a license to use the 500px APIs and you are directed to immediately cease using the 500px APIs.

## Purpose
The purpose of the 500px APIs is to permit registered users ("API Users") to develop applications that interface with the 500px site for the purpose of importing, exporting and sharing content and data with the 500px website and providing products and services to its members.

## Registration
To become an API User you must register and be approved by 500px. As part of the registration and approval process you will be asked to provide your name, email and contact information, the name, email and contact information of the entity or company you represent, as well as details about the 500px API application you intend to develop and/or the products and/or services you intend to offer to 500px members using the 500px API. It is your responsibility to ensure the information provided to 500px is complete, true and accurate throughout your period as a 500px API User. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or 500px has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, 500px may terminate your 500px API license and/or the 500px Agreement.

During registration, you may be asked to provide an e-mail address and to create your own password. Your e-mail address will become your user identification. Upon being accepted as an API User you will be issued one or more API keys for use with your 500px APIs. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and your API keys and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password and API keys. You agree to immediately notify 500px of any unauthorized use of your password, API keys or any other breach of security. 500px reserves the right to approve and authorize API Users at its discretion.

## Grant of 500px API License
The 500px APIs are owned by 500px Inc. Upon your acceptance as an API User you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, worldwide license to use each 500px API and API Key delivered to you by 500px for the purpose authorized in your registration and acceptance as an API User, subject to the terms and conditions contained in these API Terms of Use and the other parts of your 500px Agreement. The terms and conditions of your 500px Agreement apply to all copies of the 500px APIs made by or for you, and to all updates, revisions, and substitutions, if any.

Photos and images on the 500px site are owned by 500px members and not by 500px. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by 500px and/or its members.
